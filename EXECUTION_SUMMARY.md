# EXECUTION_SUMMARY — Luna Track A

## What you are shipping

A **relationship chief-of-staff coach** in ChatGPT:

- Lite archetype (text quiz)
- Deep archetype (voice transcript)
- DateOps (criteria plan + invite scripts)
- Analytics + feedback loop

## What you are NOT shipping (Track A)

- Matching marketplace
- Messaging
- Paid introductions
- Venue recommendations by name

## Competitive posture

You are **not in the lane** of funded matching startups.  
You ride alongside existing apps, improving outcomes.

## Why this is viable for 10–15 hrs/week

- ChatGPT does reasoning (no server-side OpenAI calls)
- Server is: validate + store + metrics
- Minimal infra: Supabase + Railway

## Week 4 targets (raised bar)

- 1,000 archetypes stored
- 40% deepening (lite → deep)
- 25% share rate
- 50% D7 retention
- 20% DateOps attach rate

If you hit these, Track B options open (niche matching, B2B licensing, or partnerships).
