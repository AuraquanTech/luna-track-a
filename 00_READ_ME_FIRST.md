# 00 — READ ME FIRST (Track A)

You’re shipping a **relationship chief-of-staff coach** in ChatGPT.

**NOT** dating app. **NOT** matchmaking.  
Value = **self-knowledge + scripts + DateOps** that works alongside Hinge/Bumble/Tinder/IRL.

## What’s real (no lies)

- You can analyze **psycholinguistics from transcripts** (word choice, framing, values).
- You **cannot** analyze prosody inside ChatGPT *yet* (tone/pitch).
- You **cannot** safely output factual venue names without a real Places API.
- ChatGPT **does the reasoning**, server **validates + stores** (near-zero marginal cost).

## The wedge

Tier 1: **Text quiz (Lite)** → share card  
Tier 2: **Voice transcript (Deep)** → richer dossier (optional)

Retention loop: **DateOps** (constraints → criteria plan → invite script → debrief)

## Your only Week 1 success condition

- Supabase schema applied
- MCP server deployed + `health()` returns ok
- One archetype stored end-to-end (from ChatGPT to DB)
