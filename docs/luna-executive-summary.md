# LUNA TRACK A — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Jan 12, 2026)

**Decision:** ✅ SHIP IMMEDIATELY  
**Positioning:** Relationship Chief-of-Staff Coach (NOT dating app)  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks to launch, 13 weeks to 1K users  
**Cost:** $25/mo

---

## THE SITUATION

**Market Validation (Good News):**
- Known (SF): $9.7M seed, voice dating, 80% conversion, shipping Q1 2026
- Overtone (Match Group): Voice-first dating, shipping mid-2026
- **Conclusion:** Voice dating is VALIDATED. The market is massive.

**Competitive Threat (Bad News):**
- Both are building matching apps (Known: 26-min onboarding; Overtone: Hinge network)
- Both are heavily funded (Known: $9.7M; Overtone: unlimited Match backing)
- Both target "swipe fatigue"

**Your Advantage:**
- Solo founder, 10–15 hrs/week, $25/mo budget
- Unique: ChatGPT distribution (100M+ weekly users)
- Can't compete on matching (scale + capital)
- **Can** compete on positioning + distribution

---

## THE PIVOT

### ❌ OLD STRATEGY (Jan 11)
"Voice-first dating app. Get archetype, then we match."

**Why it fails:** Head-to-head with Known/Overtone on matching.

### ✅ NEW STRATEGY (Jan 12)
"Relationship Chief-of-Staff Coach. Get archetype, plan dates, refine yourself. NOT a matchmaker."

**Why it works:** Complementary (coach), not competitive (matchmaker). No network effects. Single-player value. DateOps retention loop. Data moat.

---

## WHAT CHANGED

**SYSTEM_PROMPT.md lines 1–20:** Positioning only (coach, not matchmaker)

**Everything else:** Unchanged (code, timeline, cost, architecture)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS (Week 4: Jan 24)

By Friday, Jan 24, all 6 must be green:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Archetypes Stored | ≥ 1,000 |
| Deepening % | ≥ 40% |
| Share Rate | ≥ 25% |
| D7 Retention | ≥ 50% |
| DateOps Attach | ≥ 20% |
| Feedback Signal | ≥ 30% |

**Green → Continue. Red → Pivot or shut down.**

---

## TRACK B DECISION GATES

### Week 8–13 (Feb 21 – Mar 28)

**Known dominates + you're <1K users:**
→ Pivot to B2B licensing or shut down

**Known stalls + you're 5K+ users:**
→ Build Track B matching (raise funding, hire team)

**In-between:**
→ Hold Track A, monitor Known, prepare to pivot/raise
